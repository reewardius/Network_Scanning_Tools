# Nslookup Scanner

It is a network administration command-line tool used for querying the Domain Name System (DNS) to obtain domain name or IP address mapping or for any other specific DNS record.

# Reverse Nslookup Scanner

 A reverse DNS lookup or reverse DNS resolution (RDNS) is the querying of the Domain Name System (DNS) to determine the domain name associated with an IP address â€“ the reverse of the usual "forward" DNS lookup of an IP address from a domain name. The process of reverse resolving an IP address uses PTR records. The reverse DNS database of the Internet is rooted in the arpa top-level domain.
